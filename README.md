# prepare-data

Here are steps:

1. Go (NCBI)[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/], enter your Bioproject, and go to the dataset. For this tutorial, I will use PRussin 2019, which si PRJNA525405.
2. Click on "SRA" under 'RElated information' on the right side of the page.
3. You should see a pop-up above 'Links from BioProject in the center, that says "View results as an expanded interactive table using the RunSelector. Send results to RunSelector". Click on "RunSelector".
4. You should see a table with all the runs.
